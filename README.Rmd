```{r}
max(ames$`Sale Price`, na.rm = FALSE)
min(ames$`Sale Price`, na.rm = FALSE)
IQR(ames$`Sale Price`, na.rm = FALSE)
mean(ames$`Sale Price`,na.rm = FALSE)
median(ames$`Sale Price`,na.rm = FALSE)
```
```{r}
library("ggplot2")
```

```{r}
ggplot(ames, aes(x = `Sale Price`)) +
  geom_histogram()
```


4. num of bedrooms compared to sales price

```{r}
ggplot(ames, aes(x = `Sale Price`, y = Bedrooms)) +
  geom_point()
```

the scatterplot of bedrooms and sale price shows the variation of price for each different number of bedrooms.
